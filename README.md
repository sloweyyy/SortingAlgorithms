# Sorting Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++.

## Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are implemented:

+ Bubble Sort
+ Selection Sort
+ Insertion Sort
+ Merge Sort
+ Quick Sort

## Usage
Each sorting algorithm is implemented as a separate function in the sorting_algorithms.cpp file. To use a specific sorting algorithm, simply call its corresponding function and pass in the array to be sorted, as well as its size.

For example, to sort an integer array using the bubble sort algorithm:
```
int arr[] = {5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6};
int size = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);
BubbleSort(arr, size);
```

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you would like to add a new sorting algorithm, please create a new function in the sorting_algorithms.cpp file and include a brief description of the algorithm in this README file.
